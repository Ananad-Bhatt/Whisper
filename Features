Diffie - Hellman algo

p and g are public key also large prime number - static
a and b are private key, which is only known to yourselves
A = (g^a) % p - Your public key
B = (g^b) % p

A and B will be shared

shared secret = (B^a) % p = (A^b) % p


I have this type of structure in my DB

CHATS -> 
	senderPush() + reciverPush() -> 
		push() -> 
			MESSAGE:String, 
			TIMESTAMP:Long, 
			SENDER_KEY:String(senderPush()),
			SENDER_UID:String(senderUID)

CHAT_ROOMS ->
	senderPush() + reciverPush() -> 
		IS_ACCEPTED:Boolean, 
		LAST_MESSAGE:String, 
		USER_1:String(senderPush()),
		USER_1_UID:String(senderUID), 
		USER_2:String(reciverPush()),
		USER_2_UID:String(receiverUID)

USERS ->
	userKey ->
		userPush() ->
			EMAIL:String, 
			EMAIL_VERIFIED:String, 
			USER_NAME:String,

USER_DETAILS -> 
		userKey ->
			userPush() ->
				ABOUT:String, 
				IMAGE:String, 
				ACCOUNT_TYPE: String,
				USER_NAME:String,
				IS_OPENED:Boolean

As you can see I have 4 tables, and 100% of my data retrival is from key of a user, Now I wanted to add feature of multiple account from same email address, I have everything including logic, But I dont know What should I do with DB, how can I add this in DB...

Initially I thought of adding like
	USER_DETAILS -> userKey -> userName -> ...

But then I need to change my whole code because now to find a perticular user I need its userName not a key, And I can also do that, But the main problem is that I cannot manage both Key and Username together as a primary key, For example in CHAT_ROOM and CHAT, I managed whole thing with key
