Hello, I am HET SHUKLA.
This is my final year project (Minor project).
It took me almost 3 months to make and still it has lots of bugs, But I did it without any reference, Now I am not going to continue working on this as I already submitted this project and I have many projects to complete, So, If you want a reference or wanted to help in contribution then you can, I've used 3 APIs (GEMINI , MAPS, ZEGOCLOUD for voice and video call), So if you wated to run application, you need to add this 3 APIs of your own.

Main aim of this project/app is to provide privacy to the user, and because of it , this app is little bit slow, but it provides complete privacy while chatting.

NOTE : This is my first project in android so you can see my lack of experience in my code.

Features :
  1. End to End Encryption Chat (In text, Image, Location, Contact sharing) Using DIFFIE - HELLMAN ALGORITHM
  2. Follow, Request, Unfollow, Block user
  3. Give ALIAS to the user for notification, So your given name will be displayed in notification
  4. Post Image, UPVOTE and DOWNVOTE post
  5. Customize application theme with any given color like RED, YELLOW, GREEN etc. and also select Dark, Light and System Default theme
  6. Search User
  7. Change Account Visibiliy (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, NOT VISIBLE)
  8. Chat and Post notification to user using FCM
  9. voice call and Video call using ZEGOCLOUD (For that both needs to be online in chat)
  10. Request for message
  11. Create Multiple account from same email address

  1. [GLIDE for Image](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
  2. [SSP and SDP for responsiveness](https://github.com/intuit/ssp)
  3. [Image Picker](https://github.com/Dhaval2404/ImagePicker)

From here you can download the application (Note : Video call, Voice call and GEMINI AI might not work because free trial of Zegocloud and Gemini API is expired)
